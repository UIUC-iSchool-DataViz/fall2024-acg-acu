## Warm-Up Activity

1. What is the visualization trying to show?
1. What are its methods?
1. What are the strengths / weaknesses?
1. (Bonus) Where is the outright error?

## Data Formats: Overview

When we recieve data, it will not (necessarily) already arrive loaded in to our data processing tool of choice.

But even loading the data is only the first step.  To understand how to build representations, we have to have at least a passing understanding of how the data is represented internally, and what that means about its content and meaning.

## Organization

|       | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Row 1 | 11       | 21       | 31       | 41       |
| Row 2 | 12       | 22       | 32       | 42       |
| Row 3 | 13       | 23       | 33       | 43       |

Internally, this data is stored linearly, with one value immediately following
another.  We can do this in two methods:

|        |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| Column | 11  | 12  | 13  | 21  | 22  | 23  | 31  | 32  | 33  | 41  | 42  | 43  |

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

If we assume ASCII encoding, this becomes:

|                                           |     |     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| "390" <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 51  | 57  |

<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

Breaking this further down, we encode each character:

|                                        |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 51 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 57 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 48 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

---

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

This is then translated into a floating point number:

|                                           |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 390.0 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 96  | 120 | 64  |

<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

---

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

|                                                   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;"-->

And this is translated into a floating pointer number as well:

|                                                  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Types of Data

We will talk about two basic types of data: numerical/quantitative and categorical/qualitative.

(There are lots of subtleties we will, for now, gloss over.)

---

## Types of Data: Categorical and Qualitative

<div class="fragment" data-markdown=true>

**Nominal data** is something you can give a name to.  This might be things like, "favorite color" or "originating state."

</div>
<div class="fragment" data-markdown=true>

**Ordinal data** is that which you can place in order or rank.  This might be something like a Likert scale, where choices are ranked.

</div>

---

## Types of Data: Numerical and Quantitative

<div class="fragment" data-markdown=true>

**Discrete data** is countable, and separable into distinct pieces.  This would be, for instance, "the number of people sitting in a classroom."

</div>
<div class="fragment" data-markdown=true>

**Continuous data** is measurable, and takes on a continuous set of values.  Things like weight, volume, length, density, etc.

</div>

notes:

Dennis Reynolds:
\[to Charlie\] Alright buddy now explain to me how exactly we are going to calculate the totals?

Charlie Kelly:
Oh its easy dude. You pour gas into the car using one of these funnels, right. And I count how much gas is going into the car.

Dennis Reynolds:
Alright, let me, let me just stop you right there. How exactly are you planning on COUNTING a liquid?

Charlie Kelly:
Uhh, I know how to count dude


---

## Continuous Data

Data organized in a continuous fashion along one or more dimensions can enable
additional operations.

---

## Data Types

When we are examining data, what can we look for?

- Does this data describe a **geometric** object?
- Are the data points **connected** to each other?
- Can we describe data points with a fixed set of **categories**?
- Is there a **quantity** associated with the data?
- Are the datapoints **continuous** along one or more dimensions?

## Representations

We will concern ourselves with understanding two representations of an image:
the **raster** representation and the **vector** representation.


---

## Representations: raster

- Each pixel is represented as a color
- Common file formats such as GIF, JPG, PNG
- Compression can be lossy (JPG) or lossless (PNG)

In a raster image, you describe precisely what to display.


---

## Representations: vector

- Each component is defined as a "drawing" component, or some action to be
  taken by the rendering engine.  This can include paths, patterns,
  shapes, and text.  Components have properties associated with them.
- Common file formats are SVG, PDF, EPS
- The display does not exist until it is "rendered."
- Options for compression include (lossless) text compression, although
  the rendering engine can simplify display

## Text

Modern fonts are composed of glyphs defined by functional forms of their shape.
Font rendering engines such as freetype2 can generate bitmaps for fonts
rendered at specific resolutions.

In raster image file formats, fonts do not need to be embedded: the rasterized,
rendered version is the one that is transmitted to the viewer.

In vector file formats, fonts can either be embedded (in whole or in part) or
fallback fonts available to the rendering engine can be used.

## Doing Stuff with Data

Now that we understand a few ways that data can be stored, and
how we draw with it, let's do some things to it.

---

<div class="left" data-markdown="true">

![](images/palette.svg)<!-- .element: style="height: 20em;" -->

</div>

<div class="right" style="font-size: 150%;">
<div style="height: 4.0em;"></div>
You have a palette of operations to apply.
</div>


---

## Filtering Operations

- Relationships:
  - Equality, inequality
  - Quantitative value (less than, greater than)
  - Intersection, disjoint
- Subsampling
  - Regular sampling
  - Randomized sampling
  - Nyquist frequency
- Related data queries
  - Queries on other columns at fixed row location

## Sampling

We can choose a subset of points and use those to explore our data.  This is
not without its possible faults, however.

## Mutation Operations

- Mathematical operations, such as injective operations.
  - Logarithmic versus linear representations
  - Arithmetic or multiplicative relationships
  - Manifold remapping
- Smoothing (reduction; not injective)
- Histograms (reduction; not injective)


---

## Binning and Histograms

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../week03/images/circles_grid_filled.svg" data-background-size="auto 75%" data-background-position="right 20% bottom 50%"-->

- $\Sigma 1$ (count)
- $\Sigma v_i$ (sum)
- $\frac{\Sigma v_i }{ \Sigma 1}$ (average)
- $\frac{\Sigma v_i w_i}{\Sigma w_i}$ (weighted average)


---

## Splitting Operations

We can split or group collections of data based on some characteristic.

## Relationships Examples

- Equality
  - Identity
  - Quantitative values
- Ordering or quantitative
  - Less than (or equal)
  - Greater than (or equal)
  - "Comes before" and "Comes after"
- Set-based operations
  - "Is a member"
  - "Is not a member"
  - "Shares members"
  - "Shares no members"


---

## Examples

### Equality

```
value == "hello"
value == 10
```

### Ordering and Quantitative

```
value < 30
value > July 1, 2010
```

### Set-Based

```
value in ("red", "blue")
value not in (3.141, 2.7)
```


---

## Examples: Quantity

We can encode the values associated with a data point by modifying how we
express it.  To do so, we need to be able to identify the different components
of representation, and how we can scale between them.

## Distributions

Given a point or set of points, how do we make them into a "continuous"
distribution?

## Distributions

Given a point or set of points, how do we make them into a "continuous"
distribution?

Uniform-width bins allow us to compute:

```python
bin_id = floor( (value - left_edge ) / bin_width)
```

## Binning and Histograms

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../week03/images/circles_grid_filled.svg" data-background-size="auto 75%" data-background-position="right 20% bottom 50%"-->

- $\Sigma 1$ (count)
- $\Sigma v_i$ (sum)
- $\frac{\Sigma v_i }{ \Sigma 1}$ (average)
- $\frac{\Sigma v_i w_i}{\Sigma w_i}$ (weighted average)


---

## Summation

Useful for describing total quantity measured.

- Inches of rain.
- Total time of recorded UFO sitings in the area.
- How many votes were cast?


---

## Arithmetic Average

Useful for describing average or mean quantity.

- Average rainfall in the area.
- Average time of UFO sighting.
- Who was the average candidate?


---

## Weighted Average

Useful for describing mean, but not strict arithmetic mean.

- Average rainfall, weighted by how humid it was that day.
- What was the most commonly seen UFO type, as a function of the time it was
  seen?
- What's the mean age of a voter, as a function of the total years of
  experience in the election?


---

## Scales and Scaling

Displaying a quantity requires assigning to it a given representation.
A common mechanism for doing this is to vary the color of a particular region
or set of display units with respect to the quantity expressed in those units.

In mathematical notation, we first "normalize" our data value by assigning to a
range:

$g(v) \rightarrow v' \in [0, 1]$

and then, given a color mapping function, assign to this a given color:

$f(v') \rightarrow (R, G, B)$


---


## Scales and Scaling

Group discussion:

- How is this similar to or different from our discussions of "binning" and
  histogramming?
- What are some functions we can use for $g(v)$?
- What are some considerations we need to take into account for variable
  bins?


---

## Histograms and Binning

Group work:

Write a function -- in plain language at first, and then in python -- that
takes a set of values, a series of bin "edges," and returns to you the integer
IDs of the bins that each belongs to.

## Dimensions of Representation

Given a single datum on a visualization, we can control several different
components of its representation.
