## Evaluating Visualization Engines

- Costs
- Functionality
- Aesthetics

---

## Choices

- Can I get ahold of this software?
- Do I install it, or do I use it on a server?
- What's the user interface like?
- Is it declarative or is it procedural?

---

## License: Software

- What can you do with the software?
- Can you study the software?
- Who can you share it with?
- Who can you give your derivative works to?

---

## License: Software

- Copyleft: share and share-alike
- Non-copyleft: share, but don't necessarily need to share-alike
- https://choosealicense.com/

---

## License: Data

- What can you do with the data?
- How do you credit that data?
- Can the data be redistributed, remixed, modified?
- http://opendefinition.org/guide/data/
- https://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing

---

## Accessibility

- Is the software installed locally on your machine?
- Is it hosted at a local or remote instance?
- Who owns the visualizations, and how is access to them controlled?

---

## Interface

How do you interact with the software?

- Declarative: how do you want the plot to look?
- Procedural: what are the steps to make the plot look that way?

---

## Example Declarative

```python
Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    X('precipitation', bin=True),
    Y('count(*):Q')
)
```

## Evaluation: Costs

The "cost" of software is not exclusively the number of dollars you place on the counter when you get a big cardboard box with marketing blurbs on the side.

Think about cost in several ways:

- Monetary cost for *you* to use the software
- Monetary cost for *someone else* to view your creations
- Temporal cost of setting up
- Cognitive cost for learning and using the system (documentation matters!)
- Transmission cost for sharing your creations

---

## Evaluation: Aesthetics

Visualization is trendy.

When you construct something, think about the different ways it will be interpreted:

- How will the viewer understand the story of the data?
- What will the _message_ of the visualization be?
- Does the visualization say something about you and your handling of the data or utilization of tools?

## More vega-lite

Today we will fill out more components of our understanding of vega-lite.  Last
week we discussed marks and encodings.  This week we will continue with marks,
adding on transformations and selections.

Recall that vega-lite is defined in a JSON specification.  This specification will typically take a form similar to this:

```json
{
  "data": .. ,
  "transform": [ .. ],
  "mark": .. ,
  "params": .. ,
  "encoding": .. ,
  "config": ..
}
```


---

## vega-lite marks

vega-lite has numerous different `mark` types.  We can break these down by the type of data they can represent.  We will only consider "primitive" marks today.

- `area` & `line`
- `bar` & `rect`
- `point` & `circle` & `square`
- `rule` & `text`
- `tick`
- `geoshape`

We will demonstrate several of these using our datasets, but first we need to learn how to transform data.


---

## vega-lite transformations

At the `view`-level of your definition, you can specify transformations that modify, filter, or reshape the data.

At the top level, we specify a transformation.  We can transform data within a given dataset (by specifying a new attribute of each data point) or by reshaping the data.

The types of transformations we will cover today are `filter` and `calculate`.


---

## vega-lite filtering

We apply a `filter` transform by specifying the field to filter on and the filtering characteristic.  This can be a selection, an expression, or a logical definition.  We will address selection and expression filtering later.


---


## vega-lite filtering

A logical filtering operation might look like one of these:

```json
"transform": [
  {"filter": {
      "field": "eye_color", "oneOf": ["blue", "brown"]
      }
  },
  {"filter": {"field": "age", "lte": 100 }
  }
]
```

We can use `lt`, `gt`, `lte`, `gte`, `eq`, `oneOf`, `range` and `valid`.


---

## vega-lite calculate

We can also compute a new field using the `calculate` transform.  This is an expression that is evaluated on every data point, which is supplied as the variable `datum` to the expression.

```json
"transform": [
  {"calculate": "datum.age / 7", "as": "dog_years"}
]
```


---

## vega-lite selections

Selections are defined with *names* -- this seems to be the most common stumbling block.  You get to choose the name!

We use selections in one of a few ways.

- We can conditionally encode data -- for instance, change visibility, or alpha, or color.
- We can use selections as input for filtering data.  Typically this is done with one plot showing unfiltered data and another using a filter from that selection.
- Scale a domain based on a selection

---

## vega-lite selections

There are three types of selections:

- `single` -- selecting a single point,
- `multi` -- multiple points
- `interval` -- collections of values along encoding axes

We will focus on the `interval` selection.

---

## vega-lite interval selection

We can define a box-based selector that operates along the x axis by specifying which encoding it is linked to.  Here, we name it `valrange`, but we can choose whatever name we like.

```json
"params": [{
    "name": "valrange",
    "select": {"type": "interval", "encodings": ["x"]}
    }]
```

Let's try this.


---

## Using vega-lite with your own data

We will utilize Jupyterlab to visualize data using vega-lite, including our Building Inventory, after we prepare it.

We will edit files ending in `.vg`, and they can access files we prepare in notebooks.


---

## Embedding vega-lite

You must include the correct javascript includes to embed vega-lite in the `&lt;head&gt;` section of your HTML.  For instance:

```html
 &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5.25.0/build/vega.min.js"
        integrity="sha256-na2uPt+tUPV7GRVpc+/ezQj+lGwljIvOJifkmg8f3as=" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5.15.0/build/vega-lite.min.js"
        integrity="sha256-WLAn82Ut4GptY/IJf4K/1i+R8ibAkVLFhBVkOovqCK8=" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6.22.2/build/vega-embed.min.js"
        integrity="sha256-GfFZ6w7V/y3Ws9eHVsOXZ/F1ZFroThVZraOAx3HAt6s=" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

---

## Embedding vega-lite

Embedding vega-lite requires identification of a DOM element within which to place your visualization as well as providing the specification of that visualization.  For example, we can define a `&lt;div&gt;` like so:

```html
&lt;div id="viz"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

And then we can utilize the `vegaEmbed` function like so:

```javascript
vegaEmbed('#viz', vlSpec);
```
